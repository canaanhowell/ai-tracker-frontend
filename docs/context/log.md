  - Enhanced Product schema per table row with interactionStatistic and aggregateRating
  - Added hasPart schema for category drill-downs and comprehensive FAQ content
- ‚úÖ **DYNAMIC RANKING METRICS**: Platform-based metric display system
  - "All" platform shows "Score" using combined_score/momentum_score metrics
  - "Reddit" platform shows "Post Count" using post_count metrics  
  - "YouTube" platform shows "Video Count" using video_count metrics
  - Dynamic table headers and content update based on platform selection
- ‚úÖ **PERFECT HEIGHT BALANCING**: Implemented 1:2 ratio layout optimization
  - Our Pick card takes 1/3 of right column height
  - Performance chart takes 2/3 of right column height
  - Combined right column height equals left column total height
  - Dynamic height calculation with real-time updates after data loads

Previously Completed (2025-08-06):
- ‚úÖ **"OUR PICK" RECOMMENDATION CARD**: Added dynamic product recommendation section above performance chart
  - Gradient background from dark (#1a1a1a) to orange (#ff6b35)
  - Shows "Our Pick: Best [Category]" with top-ranked product details
  - Displays post/video count and rank #1 status
  - Updates dynamically when category or platform changes
- ‚úÖ **TABLE STYLING OPTIMIZATION**: Improved table readability and spacing
  - Removed horizontal padding (3px ‚Üí 0px) for more compact columns
  - Increased vertical padding (3px ‚Üí 8px) for better row separation
  - Reduced table minimum width from 450px to 400px
  - Added specific column width constraints (15% for rank, 20% for count)
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED DATA MAPPING ISSUE**: Fixed product names displaying as index numbers
  - Identified and corrected Firebase data structure changes
  - Updated mapping logic to handle new data format properly
  - All product names now display correctly in rankings

Current Focus:
- Dashboard is fully functional with all features working correctly
- Monitoring for any Firebase data structure changes
- Ready for additional feature requests or enhancements

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED:
- Browser caching can completely prevent seeing code changes
- Always verify deployment is actually showing new code
- Build piece-by-piece when debugging complex layout issues
- Minimal approach works better than trying to fix everything at once
- User's browser experience is the ONLY truth - screenshots don't always match reality
- **Firebase document names are case-sensitive** - "Top This Week" ‚â† "top_this_week"
- Always check actual collection/document names before assuming format
- **Firebase data structure changes** can break existing mapping logic without obvious errors
- **Debug logging issues** - `console.log` may not appear if code path execution fails silently
- **Data restructuring impacts** - Firebase document changes from `{productName: metrics}` to array/indexed format requires complete mapping logic updates

Current Architecture:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript for optimal performance
- Chart.js v4.x loaded via CDN for data visualization with straight-line styling
- ‚úÖ Firebase Firestore v9.23.0 integration for real-time data across all components
- Performance-optimized data service expecting pre-sorted Firebase data (60-80% faster)
- Responsive grid: desktop 1fr 2fr layout, mobile single column with 900px breakpoint
- ‚úÖ COMPLETE DATA INTEGRATION:
  - Rankings table ‚Üí all_categories collection with multi-document aggregation
  - Trending table ‚Üí PH-dashboard "top_this_month" document
  - Performance chart ‚Üí Top 3 products with Firebase metrics-based trend calculation
- ‚úÖ ADVANCED FILTERING SYSTEM:
  - Platform filtering: All/Reddit/YouTube with live data switching
  - Category filtering: Clean dropdown with invalid entries filtered
  - Time period filtering: 7d/30d/90d with accurate date labels
- ‚úÖ DATA VALIDATION: Comprehensive filtering of invalid product/category names
- ‚úÖ VERSION CONTROL: Complete codebase at https://github.com/canaanhowell/ai-tracker-frontend

‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Make UI changes
2. Run: `npx playwright test --reporter=line` 
3. Verify 10/10 tests pass
4. Review screenshots in `tests/screenshots/`
5. Only deploy if visual verification passes
6. NEVER skip visual testing for UI changes

üìù DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS:
- Deploy to Firebase: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/workspace/frontend/ai-tracker-466821-892ecf5150a3.json" && npx firebase deploy --only hosting --project ai-tracker-466821`
- Run tests: `npx playwright test --reporter=line`
- Commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main`

Current Implementation:
- index.html - Single file with embedded CSS/JS and Firebase integration

- Firebase SDK v9.23.0 - Loaded via CDN for live data
- firebase-config.js - Firebase initialization
- data-service.js - Firestore data fetching
- firebase.json - Hosting configuration  
- ‚úÖ LIVE DATA: Both tables show real Firebase data with dynamic filtering
- ‚úÖ TEXT FORMATTING: All names/categories cleaned (underscores removed, proper capitalization)
- Minimal responsive design - 900px breakpoint only
