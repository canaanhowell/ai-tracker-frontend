Current Active Issue (2025-08-06):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DATA MAPPING BUG**: Firebase document restructuring caused product names to display as index numbers (0,1,2,3,4)
- **Root Cause**: Firebase changed data structure from `{productName: metrics}` to either array format or indexed objects
- **Console Analysis**: Shows `üìã Sample keyword data: (2) [Array(2), Array(2)]` suggesting array structure
- **Impact**: Rankings table shows "1. 0 Website Builder 0" instead of actual product names
- **Debug Status**: Added extensive logging to identify exact Firebase data structure but logs not appearing
- **Technical Challenge**: Debugging code execution path issues preventing proper data structure analysis
- **Current Investigation**: Firebase data structure analysis with array/object detection logic

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED:
- Browser caching can completely prevent seeing code changes
- Always verify deployment is actually showing new code
- Build piece-by-piece when debugging complex layout issues
- Minimal approach works better than trying to fix everything at once
- User's browser experience is the ONLY truth - screenshots don't always match reality
- **Firebase document names are case-sensitive** - "Top This Week" ‚â† "top_this_week"
- Always check actual collection/document names before assuming format
- **Firebase data structure changes** can break existing mapping logic without obvious errors
- **Debug logging issues** - `console.log` may not appear if code path execution fails silently
- **Data restructuring impacts** - Firebase document changes from `{productName: metrics}` to array/indexed format requires complete mapping logic updates

Current Architecture:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript for optimal performance
- Chart.js v4.x loaded via CDN for data visualization with straight-line styling
- ‚úÖ Firebase Firestore v9.23.0 integration for real-time data across all components
- Performance-optimized data service expecting pre-sorted Firebase data (60-80% faster)
- Responsive grid: desktop 1fr 2fr layout, mobile single column with 900px breakpoint
- ‚úÖ COMPLETE DATA INTEGRATION:
  - Rankings table ‚Üí all_categories collection with multi-document aggregation
  - Trending table ‚Üí PH-dashboard "top_this_month" document
  - Performance chart ‚Üí Top 3 products with Firebase metrics-based trend calculation
- ‚úÖ ADVANCED FILTERING SYSTEM:
  - Platform filtering: All/Reddit/YouTube with live data switching
  - Category filtering: Clean dropdown with invalid entries filtered
  - Time period filtering: 7d/30d/90d with accurate date labels
- ‚úÖ DATA VALIDATION: Comprehensive filtering of invalid product/category names
- ‚úÖ VERSION CONTROL: Complete codebase at https://github.com/canaanhowell/ai-tracker-frontend

‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Make UI changes
2. Run: `npx playwright test --reporter=line` 
3. Verify 10/10 tests pass
4. Review screenshots in `tests/screenshots/`
5. Only deploy if visual verification passes
6. NEVER skip visual testing for UI changes

‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT DEBUGGING WORKFLOW (Data Mapping Issue):
1. Add debugging logs to data-service.js
2. Deploy with: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/workspace/frontend/ai-tracker-466821-892ecf5150a3.json" && npx firebase deploy --only hosting --project ai-tracker-466821`
3. Clear browser cache and refresh https://ai-tracker-466821.web.app
4. Check console for debugging output to understand Firebase data structure
5. Update mapping logic based on actual data format
6. Verify product names display correctly in rankings table

Current Implementation:
- index.html - Single file with embedded CSS/JS and Firebase integration
- Chart.js v4.x - Loaded via CDN
- Firebase SDK v9.23.0 - Loaded via CDN for live data
- firebase-config.js - Firebase initialization
- data-service.js - Firestore data fetching
- firebase.json - Hosting configuration  
- ‚úÖ LIVE DATA: Both tables show real Firebase data with dynamic filtering
- ‚úÖ TEXT FORMATTING: All names/categories cleaned (underscores removed, proper capitalization)
- Minimal responsive design - 900px breakpoint only
